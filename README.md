# consistent_hubs_cohort

I have uploaded a list of MATLAB FILES with main aim to give a guideline how one can firstly detect hubs from an individual brain network
based on global (integrated) and local (segregated) network metrics and secondly how you can find consistent hubs across a cohort
based on replicator dynamics and gam theory.
