# consistent_hubs_cohort

I have uploaded a list of MATLAB FILES with main aim to give a guideline of how one can firstly detect hubs from an individual brain network
based on global (integrated) and local (segregated) network metrics and secondly how we can find consistent hubs across a cohort
based on replicator dynamics and game theory.
